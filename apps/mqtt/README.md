# MQTT
This directory implements a non-clustered MQTT 3.1.1 compatible broker using Hermes. The broker is not production ready and is meant only to demonstrate the structure of an application using Hermes. After adding support for clustering in Hermes, the broker will be updated to support clustering as well.
